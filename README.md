# Bug reports of Defcts4J

<b>Constructed based on the bug localization dataset Defectsj for information retrieval based bug localization</b>

Each xml file contains mainly the Summary and Description of the bug report and the relative path to the current version of the source code file.

In order to adapt the commonly used information retrieval based bug localization tool BugLocator, the xml has the version source code file in the fixedfile tag, not the fix file.
